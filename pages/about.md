It is difficult to define who I am. I studied Manufacturing Engineering from Asia 3<sup>rd</sup> oldest Engineering school, [College of Engineering Pune](https://www.coep.org.in/). Over there, I learnt how to build anything and everything mechanical! It was pretty cool working with lathes, CNCs, and also with my own hands on carpentry, sheet metal, to name a few.

I later studied Industrial Engineering, specialized in Operations Research at [The Ohio State University](https://ise.osu.edu/) where I learnt how to use and implement advanced mathematics to solve problems. I have been fascinated by the use of technology to digitize traditional Manufacturing and Supply Chain problems.

I currently work at the intersection of technology and traditional Operations. I help digitize old-school Manufacturing and Supply Chain processes to get really awesome data from these complex processes and generate insights into how to design robust, agile Operations processes.

When I am not working, I like to read, play soccer, listen to some interesting podcasts, or go for a hike in the mountains.
