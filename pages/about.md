![Headshot]({{ "/assets/img/headshot.jpg" | relative_url }})
I am a trained Industrial Engineer and a Manufacturing Engineer. I used to build cars before, now I also like building code!

I currently work at the intersection of technology and traditional Operations. I help digitize old-school Manufacturing and Supply Chain processes to get really awesome data from these complex processes and generate insights into how to design robust, agile Operations processes.

When I am not working:
* Play soccer and I am very good at it ⚽️
* Read on topics that interest me 📚
* Hike anywhere I can ⛰
* Listen to a excelctic mix of Indian rock, Progressive Rock, Ambient Soundscapes, ... 🎧
* Listen to some interesting podcasts
