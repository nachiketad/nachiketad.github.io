![Headshot]({{ "/assets/img/headshot.jpg" | relative_url }})
I am a trained Industrial Engineer and a Manufacturing Engineer. I used to build cars before, now I also like building code!

I currently work at the intersection of Technology and traditional Operations Management. I help digitize old-school Manufacturing and Supply Chain processes to get really awesome data from these complex processes.I use my skills in Advanced Analytics and Business Intelligence to then generate insights into how to design robust, agile, and sustainable Manufacturing and Supply Chain processes, or more inclusively, end-to-end Operations Management.

When I am not working:
* Play soccer and I am very good at it ⚽️
* Read on topics that interest me 📚
* Hike anywhere I can ⛰
* Listen to a eclectic mix of Indian rock, Progressive Rock, Ambient Soundscapes, ... 🎧
* Listen to some interesting podcasts
* Check out my [Now page](https://nachiketad.github.io/now/) to learn more!
