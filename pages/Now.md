## What I am learning right now
Lots of things. I like to learn Here's a list off the top of my head:
* How to effectively use [Github](https://github.com/) - Hosting my website/blog was my first successful attempt at Github
* What are vector designs and how to make logos or vector art using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
* How servers work. I had zero knowledge a year before. Now I run my own server on my [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
* Python *(Just for fun and keeping up-to-date)*. I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) ,which I love. It has integrations with Github and many add-ons to improve workflow.
* How to make good design: Typography, color scheme, etc...
