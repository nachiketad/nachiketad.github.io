# What I am doing right now!
<span size="0.6em">(This is a [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/about). The idea was first created by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) ) </span>

## What I am learning:
Lots of things. I like to learn! Here's a list off the top of my head:
* How Linux works. I removed Windows from my laptop and relearnt how a computer works! I'm using [this distro](https://pop.system76.com/). They even sell awesome and powerful laptops shipped with Linux. Go FOSS!
* How to effectively use [Github](https://github.com/) - Hosting my website/blog was my first successful attempt at Github
* What are vector designs and how to make logos or vector art using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
* How servers work. I had zero knowledge a year before. Now I run my own server on my [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
* Python *(Just for fun and keeping up-to-date)*. I use [Atom](https://atom.io/), which I love. It has integrations with Github and many add-ons to improve workflow.
* How to make good design: Typography, color scheme, etc...

### Curious to explore:
