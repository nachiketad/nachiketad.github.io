# Thoughts on Rote Memorization
I recently interviewed at a pretty well known company and presented my _Magnum Opus_ (till date). I demonstrated how I can deliver results by influencing, getting buy-ins, and managing and increasing the scope of a digital manufacturing program I nurtured and developed. But I was rejected. I had, once again, come across the mind-numbingly stupid collective psyche of idolizing rote memorization.

When I was growing up, I had classmates who were extremely dedicated. Although their dedication, as I would later find out, was to rote memorization. Not only did the Indian education system allow this, but this was celebrated. The competition in Indian academics is cut-throat, but powered by exactly the wrong kind of fuel. I even had 'friends' in my own neighborhood who would keep things secret from me/others to gain a competitive edge. Needless to say, I have effectively cut them off from my life.

A direct consequence of this system is that students aren't learning to think through their problems especially when there is no formula to memorize. Another consequence was that I never topped my high school class. After high school though, many 'toppers' fell by the wayside but I somehow managed to get into a good school for engineering. Engineering was also pretty much the same thing, but the stakes were higher.

When I started my professional career, I thought I would leave that monster behind. But I was wrong. In this interview, I was expected to know all the answers to a laundry list of 'Engineering Concepts' by a _naive, delusional "professional"_ right out of college. I could not answer several of those, partly because I don't use them on a daily basis, and partly because I would never use my brain as a memory storage device and reduce it's working capacity. To be fair, the concepts were not difficult to memorize. But I seriously doubt the efficacy of such a method to assess a candidate. I found it very illuminating that the hiring team felt that rote memorization was important enough to disqualify a candidate. One might argue successfully that I dodged a bullet.

There are instances where you could make a case for memorization. I should explicitly call out that there is a stark distinction between memorization and rote memorization. To give an example, I build various tools in Excel, and in order to be effective I have to know what formulae can & cannot achieve. There are also heuristics that help you perform much faster and better, if you memorized them. But these are examples where you use the tools/techniques daily and they help you be better at your job. It does not do a good job in assessing candidates in interviews.

I think the real peril of rote memorization lies in the territory of tough problems or people problems. What happens when you are encountered with a problem which has no solution? Can you work with first-principles to try having a first pass approximation to solving the problem? What happens when you are dealing with unresponsive teams/people to implement your ideas? These are the kind of questions which could actually highlight the talent of a candidate.
Hiring is difficult. But the wrong yardsticks can lead to sub-optimal value addition, if any, to your team.
