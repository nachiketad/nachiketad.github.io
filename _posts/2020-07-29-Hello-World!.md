I had been meaning to make a website for myself for quite some time. I experimented with Wordpress, with custom domains, with other tools to build a website and blog. But after stumbling on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I knew I had found the tools I needed.

The best part about Jekyll is that it lets you blog in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), which is stupidly easy to write. Jekyll handles everything else by converting `markdown` to `html`. Another brilliant thing about Jekyll and Github pages combo is that there are no databases to work with.

And thus, my journey to blogging starts, on my own little space on the internet! Looking forward to building out a neat little web presence.
