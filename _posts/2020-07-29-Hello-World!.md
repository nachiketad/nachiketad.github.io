I had been meaning to make a website for myself for quite some time. I experimented with Wordpress, with custom domains, with other tools to build a website and blog. But after stumbling on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I knew I had found the tools I needed.

The best part about Jekyll is that it lets you blog in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), which is stupidly easy to write. Jekyll handles everything else by converting `markdown` to `html`. Another brilliant thing about Jekyll and Github pages combo is that there are no databases to work with.

  > *Less moving parts = less pain in the neck.*

To give myself a kick-start, I migrated my LinkedIn articles over here. Now that I have established **my** place on the internet, it is but logical that all my content stays here.

And so I am excited to publish articles here.

Feel free to reach out to me via the social media handles on the footer of the site. I will be adding a 'Comments' feature to the site, if required.
